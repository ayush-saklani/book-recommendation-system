# **Recommendation Systems**

A recommendation system predicts and presents items that a user might find relevant based on preferences and behavior.

1. ### **Content Based Recommendation**
   - **Principle:** Recommends items similar to what the user has shown interest in.
   - **Approach:** Analyzes item characteristics and user preferences.
   - **Example:** Recommending movies based on genres or books based on content and genres.
2. ### **Collaborative Filtering**
   - **Principle:** Recommends items based on the preferences and behaviors of similar users.
   - **Approach:** Utilizes user-item interaction data to identify patterns.
   - **Example:** Suggesting products liked or purchased by users with similar tastes.
3. ### **Hybrid Filtering**
   - **Principle:** A combination of content-based and collaborative filtering.
   - **Approach:**  Recommends items based on user history and similar users' recommendations.
   - **Example:** Facebook and LinkedIn use hybrid filtering for personalized content.
   
# **Data Preprocessing**

Filter unnecessary data fields and remove duplicates and empty values for clean data.

# Choosing a Recommendation Algorithm

Using the "Bag of Words" algorithm, a text representation technique converting titles, summaries, or reviews into a matrix of word frequencies.

# Feature Extraction

Use book descriptions, authors' names, and genres to create a combined data field of tags for string matching.

# Data Preprocessing II

Apply the Porter Stemmer algorithm for text stripping, reducing words to their root form and minimizing redundancy.

# Algorithm Application

Utilize CountVectorizer to convert text into vectors based on word frequency, creating vectors from tags of all books.

1. ### **Euclidean Distance**
   - Measures straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space.
   - Sensitive to scale and affected by the curse of dimensionality.
2. ### **Cosine Similarity**
   - Measures cosine of the angle between two vectors.
   - Scale-invariant and suitable for high-dimensional spaces.

Apply cosine similarity algorithm to get a similarity matrix. Create a function to return 6 nearest vectors with the least cosine distance.

# Deployment and User Interface

Use Streamlit for the frontend, providing the easiest way to create a user interface for the Python application. Streamlit also offers free hosting for easy accessibility on any device with an internet browser.
