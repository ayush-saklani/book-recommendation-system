## **Recommendation Systems**

A recommendation system predicts and presents items that a user might find relevant based on preferences and behavior.

1. **Content-Based Recommendation**
   - **Principle:** Recommends items similar to what the user has shown interest in.
   - **Approach:** Analyzes item characteristics and user preferences.
   - **Example:** Recommending movies based on genres or books based on content and genres.
2. **Collaborative Filtering**
   - **Principle:** Recommends items based on the preferences and behaviors of similar users.
   - **Approach:** Utilizes user-item interaction data to identify patterns.
   - **Example:** Suggesting products liked or purchased by users with similar tastes.
3. **Hybrid Filtering**
   - **Principle:** A combination of content-based and collaborative filtering.
   - **Approach:** Recommends items based on user history and similar users' recommendations.
   - **Example:** Facebook and LinkedIn use hybrid filtering for personalized content.
